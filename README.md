# Snake Game

This is an interactive **Snake Game** built using **React**. The player controls a snake, which grows longer as it eats food, and the goal is to keep the snake alive while growing it as much as possible. The game offers two modes: **Strict Mode** and **Wrap Mode**. High scores are tracked and persisted using local storage, and the game can be paused and resumed.

## Features

1. **Classic Snake Gameplay**
   - Control the snake using the arrow keys to eat food and grow longer.
   - The game ends when the snake collides with itself or a wall (in Strict Mode).
   - The game wraps around the screen in Wrap Mode when the snake hits the boundaries.

2. **Game Modes**
   - **Strict Mode:** The game ends when the snake hits the wall.
   - **Wrap Mode:** The snake wraps around the board when it hits the wall, continuing from the opposite side.

3. **Dynamic Speed**
   - The snake's speed increases as it grows, making the game progressively more challenging.

4. **Score and High Score Tracking**
   - The player's score increases as the snake eats food.
   - The high score is saved in **localStorage** and persists even after the game is refreshed.
   - Players can reset the high score by clicking the **Reset High Score** button.

5. **Pause and Resume**
   - The game can be paused and resumed by pressing **spacebar**.

6. **Game Over Modal**
   - When the game ends, a modal shows the player's score and indicates if a new high score was achieved.
   - Players can choose to **Restart** the game or **Go Home**.

7. **Level-Up Indicator**
   - Players are notified when they **level up** after consuming enough food.

## How to Play
